The goal of this repo is to build a clone of Human Agency.

Your app should satisfy the following stories.  

Keep in mind that you do not have to implement the Facebook APIs.  You can simply save the data to the database and create any fake Facebook or Google data you need.

Your app should be running on the internet so that it can be used by other people (i.e. use Heroku or HatchBox)

```
As a user, I can create an account with Human Agency so that I can create ads on the platform.

As a user, I can log into my account on Human Agency so that the app knows which ads are mine.

As a user, I can add a headline to my ad so that my ad can run on the Facebook newsfeed.

As a user, I can add a description to my ad so that my ad can run on the Facebook newsfeed.

As a user, I can upload an image for my ad so that my ad can run on the Facebook newsfeed.

As a user, I can view all of the ads that I have created so that I review which ads are running on Facebook

As a user, I can delete an ad that I created so that I can remove ads that I do not like.

As a user, I can see a feed of all recently created ads so that I support other people's messages

+ 3 stories of your own
